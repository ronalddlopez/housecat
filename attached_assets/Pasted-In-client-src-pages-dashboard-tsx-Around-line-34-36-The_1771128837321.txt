In `@client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`:
- Around line 34-36: The dashboard removed the required /api/tests poll — add
back a lightweight TanStack Query that polls "/api/tests" every 30s alongside
the existing useQuery<DashboardData> for "/api/dashboard"; specifically, create
a second useQuery call (e.g., useQuery({ queryKey: ["/api/tests"],
refetchInterval: 30000, /* keep it lightweight: select or enabled as needed */
})) inside the same Dashboard component or page so the app continues polling
/api/tests per guidelines while leaving the current queryKey ["/api/dashboard"]
unchanged.

In `@client/src/pages/test-detail.tsx`:
- Around line 187-193: The runMutation.onSuccess handler currently invalidates
only list and dashboard queries but misses the detail queries that have infinite
staleTime; update the onSuccess of runMutation to also call
queryClient.invalidateQueries for the detail keys used elsewhere (e.g., the
per-test detail queries for "results", "timing", "uptime", and "incidents") so
that functions like runMutation, queryClient.invalidateQueries and the query
keys ["/api/tests", id, "results"], ["/api/tests", id, "timing"], ["/api/tests",
id, "uptime"], and ["/api/tests", id, "incidents"] are invalidated after a
successful run.
- Around line 196-203: The toggleMutation's onSuccess currently invalidates
queries for ["/api/tests", id] and ["/api/tests"] but not the dashboard, causing
stale dashboard counts; update the onSuccess of toggleMutation (the useMutation
defined as toggleMutation) to also call queryClient.invalidateQueries({
queryKey: ["/api/dashboard"] }) so the dashboard metrics refresh immediately
after status changes.

In `@client/src/pages/tests.tsx`:
- Around line 483-499: The Run Now icon-only Button (the Button element
rendering Loader2/Play and using mutation, testId) lacks an accessible name; add
an aria-label (or include sr-only text) to the Button so screen readers can
announce it (e.g., aria-label that references the test or testId such as "Run
test {testId}" or "Run {testName}") and ensure the label is unique by using the
existing testId/testName props; keep the existing onClick, disabled, and
data-testid behavior intact.

In `@replit.md`:
- Around line 104-110: Two duplicate "## Frontend Pages" sections
conflict—consolidate them into a single section and reconcile the API
references: remove or merge the earlier duplicated heading that mentions
`/api/tests`, update the unified "Frontend Pages" block to list each frontend
route once (/, /tests, /tests/:id, /run, /settings) and ensure the dashboard
entry references `/api/dashboard` instead of `/api/tests`; verify the Run/Test
detail descriptions (Run Now, Pause/Resume, charts, endpoints) are preserved and
de-duplicated so the resulting section passes markdownlint MD024.
